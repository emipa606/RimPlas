  <!-- Graphene -->
  <RimPlasGraphene.label>Graphene</RimPlasGraphene.label>
  <RimPlasGraphene.description>An extremely strong synthetic carbon based material used in building a variety of structures and items. It also has a good tolerance to heat and useful electrical properties. The material is more effective against compression or blunt related damage but still effective otherwise.</RimPlasGraphene.description>
